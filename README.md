# DungeonEscape
Simple retro-style RPG for Android.
This was a project for a programming class. In the future I hope to expand the concept to a full game.

You play as a monster trying to escape from the dungeon, but you have to fight past wandering adventurers and defeat the dungeon boss to reach the exit.
Choose from three different types of monsters, each with different stats and growth.
