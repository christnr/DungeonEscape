    <string name="help_text"><big>Story:</big>\nYou are a monster that lives in a dungeon and have grown
        tired of your life attacking wandering adventurers. To break the ennui you decide to leave, but the
        dungeon boss is blocking the only exit.\n\n<big>Goal:</big>\nFight your way through the adventurers
        and defeat the dungeon boss. Due to physical distancing restrictions only three adventurers are
        allowed in the room at one time. Defeat one and another is allowed in. Defeat the adventurers
        to become strong enough to defeat the dungeon boss who will not let you leave because you have
        not quarantined for two weeks.\n\n<big>How to play:</big>\nPress the arrow buttons to move your
        monster around the dungeon. If you move into a monster, you will attack it. Defeat adventurers
        to gain experience points. Gain enough points and you will level up to a maximum of level 10.\n
        \n<big>Golem:</big>\nBest for casual players. Starts with higher stats, but grows less

        slightly lower stats than the Golem, but grows faster on level up.\n\n<big>Slime:</big>\nFor those
        that love a challenge. Starts with very low stats, but has high growth potential.\n\n<big>Settings:</big>
